## From mind to mark-down

### Feel the freak and do it anyway!

So having had intense difficulty getting the confidence to write, I have reaped intense benefit from discovering the simplicity of [mark down](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

I am **very** used to having a physical keyboard. I spent a lot of time buying and breaking devices I expected to make me magically become productive.

It was a counter intuitive move!

I think I was looking for excuses to justify not releasing my text to the outside world.

### Getting To do *something*

I often listen to the [school sucks podcast](http://schoolsucksproject.com/)

Here I heard about [gtd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-3nTl8M44o)

I'll go on to discuss the method in another post, but the main point for here is that David Allen, encourages the aspiring do'er to remove psychic resistance. The bit of you than can use an excuse not to do something, to get out of work!

Mark down has offered me something of a respite.

I am writing this, because, with my phone and a few simple characters I can have a fully fledged electronic document with some pretty nice formatting without too much pain.

I am sitting on a bench getting over the crush of the morning rush hour and benefitting from the distraction this document has offered.

I am writing it using free, libre and open source software [writely](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jmartin.writeily)

All I have left to say is:

* Thankyou for reading

* Have a try yourself.  

See you in another exciting post from fdg soon ;)
